== Description ==
Tipso is a simple Wordpress tooltip plugin that displays a responsive, animated, fully customizable tooltip when the visitor hovers over the matched element.

The plugin adds a button in the editor. On click it opens a modal window where you can enter the tooltip content. It generates a shortcode and inserts it in the editor.

You can also manually add the shortcode in the editor, or you can assing the tooltip functionality to any element simply by adding a class **tipso** and for the content add a **data-tipso="Tooltip content"**
